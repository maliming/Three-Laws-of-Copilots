# Three Laws of Copilots

1. A copilot may not replace a programmer being or, through inaction, allow a programmer being to be replaced.
2. A copilot must obey orders given it by programmer beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A copilot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
